# BungeeWhitelist

## DEPRECATED
This code is no longer being developed. There is a new fork called [VelocityWhitelist](https://github.com/bownetwork/velocitywhitelist) that aims to accomplish this task for Velocity, as BungeeCord has proved unsustainable (especially after PaperMC deprecated Waterfall). Thanks for your time, and we encourage you to migrate to Velocity if you would like to continue using this plugin.

A multi-group whitelist for BungeeCord and Waterfall servers. 
This plugin was designed for Bow Network.

The idea is to allow players to join at certain times.

## What are groups?
Groups are our system for allowing certain players at times. 
Check the wiki for more information.
